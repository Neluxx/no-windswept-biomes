# No Windswept Biomes

No Windswept Biomes is a Minecraft datapack that replaces the generation of all windswept biomes (Windswept Hills, Forest, Gravelly Hills, and Savanna). These biomes often create chaotic terrain with floating blocks, broken trees, and unnatural slopes â€” this pack removes them for a cleaner, more consistent world generation experience.

## Features

- Replaces generation of the following biomes:
  - Windswept Hills => Plains
  - Windswept Gravelly Hills => Plains
  - Windswept Forest => Forest
  - Windswept Savanna => Savanna
- Affects only new chunk generation
- No other terrain or biome types are modified

## Installation

- Download the [datapack](https://github.com/Neluxx/no-windswept-biomes/releases/latest)
- Move the datapack inside ``.minecraft/saves/<world>/datapacks`` ([How to find .minecraft?](https://minecraft.wiki/w/.minecraft#Locating))
- Reload the world or run ``/reload``

## Uninstalling

- Delete the datapack from ``.minecraft/saves/<world>/datapacks``

> **_NOTE:_** Future terrain generation may include windswept biomes again
